8.13
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:27,739
I

8.14
00:00:27,739 --> 00:00:27,879
would

this

9.1

9.2
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:29,640
they

9.3
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:29,780

not,

9.14
00:00:33,719 --> 00:00:33,859
it's

9.15
00:00:33,859 --> 00:00:34,020
very

10.1
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:35,000
But

10.2

38.15
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:47,639
they're

39.1
00:02:47,639 --> 00:02:47,780
the

39.2
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:47,960
best

39.3
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:48,159
at

39.4
00:02:48,159 --> 00:02:48,319
everything.

40.1
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:48,939
They're

40.2
00:02:48,939 --> 00:02:49,080
not

40.3
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:49,240
the

40.4
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:49,400
best

40.5
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:49,560

computer

40.7
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:50,360
programming.

41.1
00:02:51,319 --> 00:02:51,500
They're

41.2
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:51,639
not

41.3
00:02:51,639 --> 00:02:51,800
the

41.4
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:51,979
best

41.5
00:02:51,979 --> 00:02:52,180
at

41.6
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:52,520
math

41.7
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:53,780
and

41.8
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:53,939
yet

41.9
00:02:53,939 --> 00:02:54,099
they

41.10
00:02:54,099 --> 00:02:54,319
still

41.11
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:54,539
run

41.12
00:02:54,539 --> 00:02:55,020
things

41.13
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:56,120
and

41.14
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:56,379
they're,

41.15
00:02:56,639 --> 00:02:56,939
they've

41.16
00:02:56,939 --> 00:02:57,060
been

41.17
00:02:57,060 --> 00:02:57,419
getting

42.1
00:02:57,919 --> 00:02:58,219
less

42.2
00:02:58,219 --> 00:02:58,960
successful,

42.3
00:02:59,439 --> 00:02:59,840
dumber

42.4
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:00,099
over

42.5
00:03:00,099 --> 00:03:00,479
time

42.6
00:03:00,479 --> 00:03:00,759
and

42.7
00:03:00,759 --> 00:03:00,919
yet

42.8
00:03:00,919 --> 00:03:01,080
their

42.9
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:01,439
power

42.10
00:03:01,439 --> 00:03:01,979
increases.

43.1
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:02,400
So

43.2
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:02,939
none

43.3
00:03:02,939 --> 00:03:03,060
of

43.4
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:03,219
these,

43.5
00:03:03,419 --> 00:03:03,599
all

43.6
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:03,840
these

43.7
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:04,340
questions

43.8
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:04,599
are

43.9
00:03:04,599 --> 00:03:04,960
really

43.10
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:05,319
just

43.11
00:03:05,319 --> 00:03:05,819
ignorant

43.12
00:03:05,819 --> 00:03:06,280
questions.

44.1
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:06,539
I

44.2
00:03:06,539 --> 00:03:06,639
mean,

44.3
00:03:06,719 --> 00:03:06,840
it's

44.4
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:06,960
like

44.5
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:07,360
someone's

44.6
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:07,699
actually

44.7
00:03:07,699 --> 00:03:08,120
asking

44.8
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:08,360
them

44.9
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:08,520
like

44.10
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:08,659
they

44.11
00:03:08,659 --> 00:03:08,919
actually

44.12
00:03:08,919 --> 00:03:09,240
don't

44.13
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:09,360
know

44.14
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:09,539
the

44.15
00:03:09,539 --> 00:03:09,900
answer.

45.1
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:12,860
So

45.2
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:13,060
no,

45.3
00:03:13,259 --> 00:03:13,379
and

45.4
00:03:13,379 --> 00:03:13,500
if

45.5
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:13,620
I

45.6
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:13,719
were

45.7
00:03:13,719 --> 00:03:13,819
to

45.8
00:03:13,819 --> 00:03:14,000
sit

45.9
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:14,340
down,

45.10
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:15,219
you

45.11
00:03:15,219 --> 00:03:15,319
know,

45.12
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:15,560
maybe

45.13
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:15,840
Keith

45.14
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:16,120
Woods

45.15
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:16,360
can

45.16
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:16,520
do

45.17
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:16,740
that

45.18
00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:16,939
for

45.19
00:03:16,939 --> 00:03:17,099
a

45.20
00:03:17,099 --> 00:03:17,280
sub

45.21
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:17,500
stack.

46.1
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:17,759
If

46.2
00:03:17,759 --> 00:03:17,900
those

46.3
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:18,039
are

46.4
00:03:18,039 --> 00:03:18,360
questions,

46.5
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:18,680
Scott

46.6
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:19,020
Adams

46.7
00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:19,340
asked,

46.8
00:03:19,479 --> 00:03:19,659
maybe

46.9
00:03:19,659 --> 00:03:19,879
it'd

46.10
00:03:19,879 --> 00:03:19,919
be

46.11
00:03:19,919 --> 00:03:20,099
worth

46.12
00:03:20,099 --> 00:03:20,240
it

46.13
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:20,419
for

46.14
00:03:20,419 --> 00:03:20,659
me

46.15
00:03:20,659 --> 00:03:20,800
or

46.16
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:21,080
Keith

46.17
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:21,759
to

46.18
00:03:21,759 --> 00:03:22,120
actually

47.1
00:03:22,139 --> 00:03:22,500
sit

47.2
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:22,740
down

47.3
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:22,900
and

47.4
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:23,240
answer

47.5
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:23,539
them

47.6
00:03:23,539 --> 00:03:23,860
and

47.7
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:24,000
give

47.8
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:24,120
a

47.9
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:24,419
treatment

47.10
00:03:24,419 --> 00:03:24,639
to

47.11
00:03:24,639 --> 00:03:24,800
them

47.12
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:25,060
because

47.13
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:25,539
every

47.14
00:03:25,539 --> 00:03:25,699
one

47.15
00:03:25,699 --> 00:03:25,800
of

47.16
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:25,919
these

47.17
00:03:25,919 --> 00:03:26,310
questions,

48.1
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:27,479
I

48.2
00:03:27,479 --> 00:03:27,599
mean,

48.3
00:03:27,699 --> 00:03:27,740
this

48.4
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:27,860
is

48.5
00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:27,960
just

48.6
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:28,080
off

48.7
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:28,240
the

48.8
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:28,479
dome

48.9
00:03:28,479 --> 00:03:28,740
has

48.10
00:03:28,740 --> 00:03:28,900
an

48.11
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:29,199
obvious

48.12
00:03:29,199 --> 00:03:29,639
answer,

48.13
00:03:29,819 --> 00:03:29,879
but

48.14
00:03:29,879 --> 00:03:30,099
people

48.15
00:03:30,099 --> 00:03:30,439
always

48.16
00:03:30,439 --> 00:03:30,659
throw

48.17
00:03:30,659 --> 00:03:30,879
shit

48.18
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:31,080
like

49.1
00:03:31,099 --> 00:03:31,300
that

49.2
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:31,599
out.

50.1
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:33,419
And

50.2
00:03:33,419 --> 00:03:33,520
of

50.3
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:33,819
course,

50.4
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:34,180
this

50.5
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:34,520
is

50.6
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:35,719
within

50.7
00:03:35,719 --> 00:03:35,900

50.9
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:36,580
where,

50.10
00:03:36,719 --> 00:03:36,879
you

50.11
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:37,039
know,

50.12
00:03:37,319 --> 00:03:37,479
it

50.13
00:03:37,479 --> 00:03:37,819
always,

50.14
00:03:38,139 --> 00:03:38,539
it

50.15
00:03:38,539 --> 00:03:38,800
always

50.16
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:39,180
happens

50.17
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:39,460
like

51.1
00:03:39,539 --> 00:03:39,699
this

51.2
00:03:39,699 --> 00:03:39,919
where

51.3
00:03:39,919 --> 00:03:40,099
we

Jews.

52.1
00:03:43,979 --> 00:03:44,180
And

52.2
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:44,400
then

52.3
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:44,819
people

52.4
00:03:44,819 --> 00:03:45,199

52.6
00:03:45,740 --> 00:03:46,060
as

52.7
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:46,400
though

52.8
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:47,120

00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:47,479
well,

52.11
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:47,680
there's

52.12
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:47,819
just

52.13
00:03:47,819 --> 00:03:48,039
no

53.1
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:49,300
It's

53.2
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:49,419
like

53.3
00:03:49,419 --> 00:03:49,599
we
