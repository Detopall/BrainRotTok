1.1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,520
behind

1.2
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:01,159
and

1.3
00:00:01,159 --> 00:00:01,760
the

1.4
00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:02,080
hamsters

1.5
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:02,319
next

1.6
00:00:02,319 --> 00:00:02,620
week.

2.1
00:00:02,799 --> 00:00:02,980
So

2.2
00:00:02,980 --> 00:00:03,700
we'll

2.3
00:00:03,700 --> 00:00:03,899
talk

2.4
00:00:03,899 --> 00:00:04,139
all

2.5
00:00:04,139 --> 00:00:04,400
about

2.6
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:04,599
the

2.7
00:00:04,599 --> 00:00:04,860
Iowa

2.8
00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:05,299
caucus.

3.1
00:00:05,559 --> 00:00:05,799
We'll

3.2
00:00:05,799 --> 00:00:05,940
get

3.3
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:06,160
into

3.4
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:06,339
all

3.5
00:00:06,339 --> 00:00:06,540
that

3.6
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:06,849
stuff

4.1
00:00:06,849 --> 00:00:07,200
and

4.2
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:07,419
what

4.3
00:00:07,419 --> 00:00:07,540
it

4.4
00:00:07,540 --> 00:00:07,679
means

4.5
00:00:07,679 --> 00:00:07,879
for

4.6
00:00:07,879 --> 00:00:08,000
the

4.7
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:08,279
race

4.8
00:00:08,279 --> 00:00:08,560
and

4.9
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:08,699
where

4.10
00:00:08,699 --> 00:00:08,859
we

4.11
00:00:08,859 --> 00:00:09,119
are.

5.1
00:00:10,019 --> 00:00:10,519
Honestly,

5.2
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:10,759
I

5.3
00:00:10,759 --> 00:00:11,039
think,

5.4
00:00:11,419 --> 00:00:11,619
and

5.5
00:00:11,619 --> 00:00:12,119
almost

5.6
00:00:12,119 --> 00:00:12,519
everyone

5.7
00:00:12,519 --> 00:00:12,890
agrees

6.1
00:00:12,890 --> 00:00:13,320
that

6.2
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:13,820
after

6.3
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:14,240
the

6.4
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:14,759
performance

6.5
00:00:14,759 --> 00:00:15,039
in

6.6
00:00:15,039 --> 00:00:15,460
Iowa,

6.7
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:16,179
it's

6.8
00:00:16,179 --> 00:00:16,519
done.

7.1
00:00:17,620 --> 00:00:17,800
The

7.2
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:18,140
primary

7.3
00:00:18,140 --> 00:00:18,359
is

7.4
00:00:18,359 --> 00:00:18,660
done,

7.5
00:00:18,839 --> 00:00:19,100
it's

7.6
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:19,519
over.

8.1
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:20,800
And

8.2
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:21,140
I

8.3
00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:21,620
wish

8.4
00:00:21,620 --> 00:00:21,839
the

8.5
00:00:21,839 --> 00:00:22,100
Trump

8.6
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:22,260
had

8.7
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:22,379
done

8.8
00:00:22,379 --> 00:00:22,500
a

8.9
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:22,719
little

8.10
00:00:22,719 --> 00:00:22,899
bit

8.11
00:00:22,899 --> 00:00:23,280
better.

9.1
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:24,620
I

9.2
00:00:24,620 --> 00:00:24,800
know

9.3
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:24,960
a

9.4
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:25,100
lot

9.5
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:25,239
of

9.6
00:00:25,239 --> 00:00:25,539
people

9.7
00:00:25,539 --> 00:00:25,980
have

9.8
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:26,160
been

9.9
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:26,519
playing

9.10
00:00:26,519 --> 00:00:26,820
up

10.1
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:27,039
what

10.2
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:27,179
a

10.3
00:00:27,179 --> 00:00:27,559
huge

10.4
00:00:27,559 --> 00:00:27,920
sweep

10.5
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:28,140
it

10.6
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:28,359
was.

11.1
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:28,620
And

11.2
00:00:28,620 --> 00:00:28,699
I

11.3
00:00:28,699 --> 00:00:28,879
think

11.4
00:00:28,879 --> 00:00:29,000
it

11.5
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:29,140
was

11.6
00:00:29,140 --> 00:00:29,260
a

11.7
00:00:29,260 --> 00:00:29,420
big

11.8
00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:29,800
deal.
