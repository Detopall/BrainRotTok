1.1
00:00:00,820 --> 00:00:01,060
And

1.2
00:00:01,060 --> 00:00:01,540
so

1.3
00:00:01,540 --> 00:00:01,940
that's

1.4
00:00:01,940 --> 00:00:02,140
why

1.5
00:00:02,140 --> 00:00:02,379
that

1.6
00:00:02,379 --> 00:00:02,560
was

1.7
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:02,980
so

1.8
00:00:02,980 --> 00:00:04,660
effective.

2.1
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:05,219
So,

2.2
00:00:05,519 --> 00:00:05,780
and

2.3
00:00:05,780 --> 00:00:06,139
that's

2.4
00:00:06,139 --> 00:00:06,299
why

2.5
00:00:06,299 --> 00:00:06,500
it

2.6
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:06,599
was

2.7
00:00:06,599 --> 00:00:06,860
truly

2.8
00:00:06,860 --> 00:00:07,080
a

2.9
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:07,900
masterful

2.10
00:00:07,900 --> 00:00:09,199
victory.

3.1
00:00:09,339 --> 00:00:09,519
Because

3.2
00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:09,699
I

3.3
00:00:09,699 --> 00:00:09,960
didn't

3.4
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:10,080
have

3.5
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:10,240
to

3.6
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:10,369
say,

4.1
00:00:10,369 --> 00:00:10,759
I

4.2
00:00:10,759 --> 00:00:10,919
could

4.3
00:00:10,919 --> 00:00:11,060
have

4.4
00:00:11,060 --> 00:00:11,279
told

4.5
00:00:11,279 --> 00:00:11,500
you

4.6
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:11,720
that.

5.1
00:00:12,199 --> 00:00:12,380
I

5.2
00:00:12,380 --> 00:00:12,539
could

5.3
00:00:12,539 --> 00:00:12,660
have

5.4
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:12,839
went

5.5
00:00:12,839 --> 00:00:13,019
on

5.6
00:00:13,019 --> 00:00:13,220
that

5.7
00:00:13,220 --> 00:00:13,560
debate

5.8
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:13,800
and

5.9
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:14,080
told

5.10
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:14,580

6.3
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:15,919
hates

6.4
00:00:15,919 --> 00:00:16,300
Catholics.

7.1
00:00:16,420 --> 00:00:16,559
He

7.2
00:00:16,559 --> 00:00:16,739
said

7.3
00:00:16,739 --> 00:00:16,980
this,

7.4
00:00:17,079 --> 00:00:17,219

7.5
00:00:17,219 --> 00:00:17,379
and

7.6
00:00:17,379 --> 00:00:17,519
this.

8.1
00:00:17,519 --> 00:00:17,879
I

8.2
00:00:17,879 --> 00:00:18,039
could

8.3
00:00:18,039 --> 00:00:18,160

I

9.2
00:00:20,199 --> 00:00:20,399
didn't

9.3
00:00:20,399 --> 00:00:20,579
need

31.4
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:32,540
just

31.5
00:01:32,540 --> 00:01:32,799

Okay,

It's

36.2
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:45,500
